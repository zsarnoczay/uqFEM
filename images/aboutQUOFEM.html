              This is the open-source quoFEM tool. 
</h1>

It is an application intended to augment finite element applications with sampling and optimization methods. These methods will allow users to provide, for example, uncertainty quantification in the structural responses and parameter estimation of input variables in calibration studies.
<p>
Version 2.2.1 of this tool utilizes the Dakota software to provide the UQ and optimization methods. Dakota will repeatedly invoke the finite element application either locally on the users dekstop machine or remotely on high performance computing resources at the Texas Advanced Computing Center through the NHERI DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure.
